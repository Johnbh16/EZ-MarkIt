    - Hi, I’m a software engineer who is interested in open source software and looking for opportunities to learn and contribute. I have some experience in creating APIs with Spring Boot and implementing DevSecOps automations using Jenkins and Python. I’m also curious about data science and machine learning, and I’m always looking for opportunities to improve my skills and knowledge in these areas. I enjoy working on projects that have a positive impact on people’s lives and solve real-world problems. I haven’t contributed to any open source projects yet, but I’m eager to do so in the future. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me.
